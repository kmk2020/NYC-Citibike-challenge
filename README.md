## Results
1.Checkout Times for users

Most riders spend 20 min riding bikes. The investors need to consider this when setting price tiers. A good exmple would be to set a unit price for the first hour and then a varrying amount absed on time or distsance covered.

2.Top Ending Locations

Most of the top ending locations are close to places of interest such as the Union Station and along roads and streets. This is key in determing whether Des Moines is fit for the bike ride share program. Are the streets in Des Moines wide enough to host charging ports, drop off & pick up points?
This information is also important in planning for mantainance schedules and routines.

3.Top Starting Locations

 The top starting points are close to the top ending locations meaning bikers dont move atoo much from their start point. This is key in planning where to set up the locations of the bike ride facilities since they would need a street to amnuerver almost freely.
 
4.Checkout Times by Gender

The plot aimed at giving a visual display of the difference in Trip duration through the different genders.  Two observations were made;
* There were more male bike riders as compared to the other genders.
* On average the trip duaration lastd for les  than 20 min among all the genders even though the male ridera had an overall longer trip durations.

 Investors in Des Moines need to bridge the gap between the two durations. To do this they could offer offers on subscription for potential female riders, or carry out a further study on why there were less female riders in the New York bike project.
5.Trips by Weekday per Hour

The peak hours for the bike rideS are 5 AM to 9 pM  and its lowest times of the day being 11pm to 4 AM. This is important in budgeting for personnel, logistics, repairs and mantainance.

6.Trips by Gender(Weekday per Hour)

 The heat map was created to display differentvlevels of bike utilization among different genders through a day in a week. Males rode more than females but both seem to ride at the same time durations. This is important in bringing all the customers on board regardless of their seperate genders.
 
7.User Trips by Gender by Weekday

 Subscribers utilise the bikes more than custoers. The invetors can focus on attracting customers into subscribers so as to gain more. The customers seem to utilize the bikes on saturday and sunday meaning they could have been busy working during the week. This can be solved by having bike spots near work places in the town so that they acn utilize them during breaks.

## Summary
The bike share project can be utilized in the City of Des Moines Iowa as it operates in New York City. To implement the project succesfully, the invesors and the development committee needs to consider other factors such as weather, security, road infrasture among other factors when evaluating the viablity of the project.
